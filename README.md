# ThmanyaTask App


## Overview
This App is an assignment aimed to showcase problem-solving skills and technical abilities as an iOS Engineer. The goal is to create a photo album application with specific functionalities.

## Assignment Description
The application comprises two main screens:
1. **Users Screen**: Displays a list of users to select one of them.
2. **Profile Screen**: Displays the user's name, address, and a list of their albums.

  - Primary URL: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
  - Endpoints:
    - User: `GET /users`
    - Albums: `GET /albums`
    - Photos: `GET /photos`

## iOS Technology Requirements
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern.
- **SwiftUI**: Utilize SwiftUI for building the user interface.
- **Swift Concurrency (Async/Await)**: Employ Swift's concurrency model for asynchronous operations.
- **Swift Package Manager**: Use Swift Package Manager for dependency management.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. open Xcode project.
3. Wait until SPM packages are loaded.
4. Build and run ðŸš€.

## All Implementation Notes are done âœ…
- Ensure proper handling of asynchronous operations using Swift Concurrency.
- Use SwiftUI to create intuitive and responsive user interfaces.
- Implement MVVM to maintain separation of concerns and facilitate unit testing.
- Utilize Swift Package Manager for managing project dependencies efficiently.

Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance during the development process.

**Good luck!** ðŸš€
